It was created to help develop programming skills based on Python and the ability to utilize generative artificial intelligence.

The way we program is changing now.

Here, we hope to make the most of these changes so that even beginners can easily understand Python and have the ability to utilize generative artificial intelligence, and become makers who implement the functions they want.

Within each Python file, you will find:
- Links showing the process of generating a program using a generative AI tool (e.g. ChatGPT o1-mini)
- Prompts used to generate the program
- Name of the generative AI tool used
